<p class="announcement-text">The organizing committees of two co-located events, EHST'19 and <a class="body-link" target="_blank" href="http://2019.ffhmt.com/">FFHMT'19</a>, have decided to allow registrants of either conference to attend sessions from both events. As a result, we encourage attendees to study the program for both conferences and attend the sessions which they may find relevant/interesting.</br>

For more information about the conferences, please view the <a class="body-link" target="_blank" href="/FFHMT19_EHST19_CFP.pdf">Conference Flyer</a>.</p>
