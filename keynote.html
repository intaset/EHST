  <p class="body">Igor Zhitomirsky is a Distinguished Engineering Professor at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He is a primary author of more than 230 papers in peer-reviewed journals and 8 patents.  His major research interests are in electrochemical nanotechnology, colloidal nanotechnology and surface modification techniques. He has developed advanced materials and manufacturing techniques for the fabrication of electrochemical supercapacitors for energy storage. His approach is focused on the advanced surface modification techniques, development of advanced dispersing and capping agents for colloidal processing of nanoparticles, development of redox binders, liquid-liquid extraction techniques for agglomerate free processing of nanoparticles, electrostatic heterocoagulation and Schiff base reactions for design of advanced nanocomposites,  polymer-mediated electrosynthesis and electrophoretic deposition techniques.</p>
