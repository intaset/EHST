  <p class="body">Dr. Curtis P. Berlinguette is a Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion, CIFAR Fellow and Professor of Chemistry and Chemical &#38; Biological Engineering at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Berlinguette completed his PhD in Inorganic Chemistry at Texas A&#38;M University (Advisor: Prof. K. R. Dunbar) and postdoctoral studies at Harvard University (Advisor: Prof. R. H. Holm). He started his independent career in the Department of Chemistry and The Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment &#38; Economy at the University of Calgary in 2006 before moving his program to the University of British Columbia in 2013. He leads a research program dedicated to solar energy conversion, which includes the design of novel nanoscale materials for advanced solar cells and developing economically viable ways of storing solar electricity as high density fuels. Dr. Berlinguetteâ€™s program has been recognized with several awards, including an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship and an NSERC E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship. </p>
